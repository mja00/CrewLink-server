# CrewLink peer to peer connection configuration.
#
# This file lets you modify how CrewLink connects players to each other.
#
# CrewLink uses peer to peer connections to establish voice calls between players. This means that every player has to
# be able to connect to every other player some way or another in order for CrewLink to work. Below you can tweak the
# mechanisms CrewLink uses to establish peer to peer connections.

# Force CrewLink to only work through TURN servers. This is great if you want to protect the IP addresses of players
# as no direct connection will be made. If set to true, a TURN server is required.
forceRelayOnly: false

# STUN servers
# A part of establishing peer to peer connections is finding out the IP address of each participant and letting people 
# connect directly to each other. A stun server, simply put, allows you to find out your public IP address and port, 
# which is something other participants need to know in order to connect to you. By default CrewLink will use one of
# Google's STUN servers.

#TURN servers:
#     Sometimes you find yourself behind a strict firewall or NAT that flat out rejects peer to peer connections. TURN
#     servers provide a way around this by acting as a middleman between peers, relaying all traffic sent between them.
#     TURN servers are the best way to guarantee that everyone can use CrewLink. By default CrewLink comes with no TURN
#     servers, so you will need to set one up. Beware that TURN servers take up a lot of bandwidth as they have to relay
#     ALL traffic between peers that use them.
